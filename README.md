The software JN-AN-1190-JenNet-IP-Application-Template is owned by NXP B.V. and/or its supplier and is protected under applicable 
copyright laws. All rights are reserved. I have adapted this template to develop an Energy Efficient Air Quality Monitoring System
to detect the conentration of various pollutants in the region of Sfax. This WSN is based on JN5168 and JenNet-IP. I designed and 
realized the electronic boards for sensor nodes and photovoltaic power supply boards. Furthermore, I developed the application layer which is 
based on the JenNet-IP protocol (6LoWPAN).
